# PygameFireEmblem
Fire Emblem created in PyGame

The ultimate goal is to create a working prototype for a new type of Real Time Strategy game, using Fire Emblem as a basis. It will contain the following features:

1) Cooldown-based movement, with mouse

2) Terrain advantages and disadvantages

3) Combat (exact mechanics to be determined)



## Current implementation

1) Grid-based movement of multiple characters with right-click on mouse or by keyboard

2) Changing selection of character with left-click or using hotkeys (1-4)
